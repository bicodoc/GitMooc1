# GitMooc1
The source code for programming exercises in the Univ of Helsinki's Java MOOC 2013 course, part 1.  The course is being updated/replaced at the current time so I'm not concerned about "letting the cat out of the bag" with these solved exercises.  There are some slight irregularities in how the code is presented, i.e. the directory structure, due to the fact that this is also a learning exercise in my use of GitHub!  Many, but not all, of the source code files include a large group of comments following my code.  The commented code is the MOOC course's recommended solution to the exercise in question.  In general, there is little difference between the code groups other than variable names and formatting preferences but there are occasional differences such as select:case structures vs if/then/else, or while loops vs for:next loops.  These differences are not difficult to understand and should be easy for even the novice coder (like me!) to figure out.
